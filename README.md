# ThesisData
This repository contains the data used in my thesis titled "Refining the geomorphological map of the Noordvoort dunes and indicating rabbit holes using LiDAR data". 

# Description
This thesis describes how LiDAR and Object Based Image Analysis can be used to indicate the geomorphological map of Noordvoort. Furthermore, an indication has been made of the amount of rabbit holes by using hand held LiDAR, which has been gathered  during fieldwork. 

# Content
This repository  consists of the following:
[BSCThesis_MapPackage_IvoHarmens13382780]: The final map packge which consists of the final geomorphological map and two plots consisting of the amount of rabbit holes. Thereby, the confusion matrix is added.
